# Real-Time 3D Rendering Project

This project demonstrates how tools like Unity can be leveraged to produce and render high-quality cinematics or videos in a very short time, showcasing an agile and efficient workflow for interactive audiovisual creation.

This project is an example of that approach, showcasing a cinematic I created by taking advantage of Unityâ€™s real-time rendering along with its creative tools. The cinematic was built entirely within Unity using the timeline, animations, audio clips, particle systems, post-processing effects, and C# scripts (no video editing software was used).

> [!NOTE]  
> When you press **Play** in the **Unity Editor**, the cinematic begins playing and rendering in real time. The final rendered video is automatically exported to the `Recordings` folder.
